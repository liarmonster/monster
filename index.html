There are many types of monsters in this world.<br>
Monster who will not show themselves and who cause trouble<br>
Monsters who abduct children<br>
Monsters who devour dreams<br>
Monsters who suck blood<br>
And... Monsters who always tell lies.<br>
Lying monsters are a real nuisance<br>
They're much more cunning than other monsters<br>
They pose as humans even though they have no understanding of the human heart<br>
They eat even though they've never experienced hunger<br>
They study even though they've no interest in academics<br>
They seek friendship even though they do not know how to love<br>
If I'd encounter such a monster, I would likely be eaten by it<br>
Because in truth... I'm that monster<br>
