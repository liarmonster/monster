There are many types of monsters in this world.
Monster who will not show themselves and who cause trouble
Monsters who abduct children
Monsters who devour dreams
Monsters who suck blood
And... Monsters who always tell lies.
Lying monsters are a real nuisance
They're much more cunning than other monsters
They pose as humans even though they have no understanding of the human heart
They eat even though they've never experienced hunger
They study even though they've no interest in academics
They seek friendship even though they do not know how to love
If I'd encounter such a monster, I would likely be eaten by it
Because in truth... I'm that monster
